# A_series_of_experiments_based_on_gyroscope
This is a mathematical modeling project in which we studied the motion of gyroscopes. I collaborate with Yifeng Chen, and Professor Charles S Peksin and Dr. Charles Puelz are our mentors.

This repo contains our code, proposal, paper, videos, and presentation for this project.
